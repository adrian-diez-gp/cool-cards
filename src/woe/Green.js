                put artifacts and/or enchantments into play, and you'll realise that this is a BEAST. Drop a color if you see one,

                5 mana cards have a cheaper adventure you can play earlier. Combo, anyone?</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: B-</strong>. Imagine you want a card that destroys artifacts and enchantments. But that card is not always good, so you leave it in the sideboard. 
                But then you reaaaally need it in your game 1. THIS is your solution to that problem. If you draw it late, no problem -just play a huge dumdum that can't
                be chumpblocked!</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: B-</strong>. There are few things better to do in limited than play on curve. If you play a 3/3 on turn 3, followed by a 4/4 in turn 4/4,
                chances are that you're ahead in the game. If you played an adventure, this is *chef's kiss*.

                <p><strong>Rating: C</strong>. This is the signpost for the 5 mana archetype. Able to do something early, and getting bigger the later it goes. Nice

                <p><strong>Rating: C</strong>. Almost all green rares are good, except if they cost 8 mana.

                <p><strong>Rating: C-</strong>. The versatility in this is why I would want one in my deck.
                It can be mana ramp/fixing, a token to block with, or two tokens for bargain purposes if I don't want more mana.
                Good only if you're base green with many colors of splash, or as the 20-23rd card in your deck.</p>
