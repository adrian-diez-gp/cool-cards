                this on a 1/1 and sacrifice a treasure/map token to kill a 4 toughness creature <em>every turn</em>. What the flail.</p>

                <p><strong>Rare - Magmatic Galleon</strong>. 
                    More often than not, a one-time removal, but a removal that leaves a body behind is good. This is only half a body,
                    but makes your small creatures useful again to crew it.

                <p><strong>Uncommon - Dreadmaw's Ire</strong>. 
                    I'm almost looking more at the "destroy target artifact" than at the +2/+2. Getting in with a few cretures, then use it on the one that will get damage through
                    to destroy a crafted artifact where they invested 10 mana for a single red sounds delicious to me!

                <p><strong>Uncommon - Calamitous Cave-In</strong>. And here is our third wrath of the collection? If I didn't know better, I'd swear 
                the guys that make the game don't like small creatures.</p>

                <p><strong>Uncommon - Triumphant Chomp</strong>. Much better in a dino deck, but I've never complained about a <a href="https://mythicspoiler.com/m14/cards/shock.jpg">shock</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>Uncommon - Zoyova's Justice</strong>. Good to reset cards? I don't like that this doesn't give you a card back.</p>
                <br />

                <p><strong>Common - Tectonic Hazard</strong>. Ping EVERYTHING from your opponents. How good will this be? We'll know in the next episode!</p>

                <p><strong>Common - Sunfire Torch</strong>. This is in the appropriate colour because it is such a slow burn. Still good, I guess.</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: C-</strong>. Once you've found <a href="https://mythicspoiler.com/woe/cards/flickacoin.jpg">ways to get any color of mana</a>, start picking these more highly. Cards that do 
                two things are usually better than cards that do one thing!</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: C-</strong>. The rat payoff. They will either let you get in for 2, 3 each turn, or they'll have to trade their real creatures with mere tokens.</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: C-</strong>. And if they have big blockers, this'll beat a path for them. Only one turn, but a later 4/4 sounds big enough for me!</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: C+</strong>. Good for 2, good for 3. <a href="https://mythicspoiler.com/woe/cards/grandballguest.jpg">There are</a> lots of 
                <a href="https://mythicspoiler.com/woe/cards/tatteredratter.jpg">two mana creatures</a>, and at <a href="https://mythicspoiler.com/woe/cards/charmingscoundrelf.jpg">all rarities</a> as well, so you won't

                <p><strong>Rating: B+</strong>. Double strike is DEVASTATING in a set with so many roles. +1/+0 is also very nice. Rat deck much?</p>
