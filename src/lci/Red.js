                every turn is what I call a sure victory! All the while enabling Descend. The red rare bomb!</p>

                this on a 1/1 and sacrifice a treasure/map token to kill a 4 toughness creature <em>every turn</em>. What the flail.</p>

                    More often than not, a one-time removal, but a removal that leaves a body behind is good. This is only half a body,
                    but makes your small creatures useful again to crew it.

                <p><strong>Uncommon - Dreadmaw's Ire</strong>. 
                    I'm almost looking more at the "destroy target artifact" than at the +2/+2. Getting in with a few cretures, then use it on the one that will get damage through
                    to destroy a crafted artifact where they invested 10 mana for a single red sounds delicious to me!

                the guys that make the game don't like small creatures.</p>

            <h3>Comments: It feels like everything in red kills! We'll have to be very careful about which spells we pick.</h3>

            <h1>Evasion (anything that gets through the invariably present ground wall)</h1>
            <p>It seems that red doesn't have evasion; instead, it has undercosted creatures (like 4/3 for 3), so there will be a tension in deckbuilding:
                do you go for small evasive creatures that can't be blocked, or do you go for big chompers that can be double blocked?
