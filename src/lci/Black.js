                <p><strong>Mythic - Aclazotz</strong>. Every time "each opponent" appears, consider the power of that card to go up by 1.5x.
                That's how strong this is!</p>

                <img className='card-wrapper' src="https://mythicspoiler.com/lci/cards/starvingrevenant.jpg"/>
                <p><strong>Rare - Starving Revenant</strong>. High risk, high reward card. The fact that it needs 8 PERMANENT cards makes me play almost no spells in that deck.
                Even if the support isn't there normally (i.e. there are no permanents that have the effect of a spell attached (see <a>Murder</a> being attached to
                <a>Ravenous Chupacabra</a>)), the fact that in a 2v2 we can split all spells in one deck and all permanents in another is a nice upside.</p>

                <p><strong>Rare - Stalactite Stalker</strong>. Not Literally a bomb, but does everything. Gets in the first few turns, gets big passively and can kill something later on.
                23 of these, 17 lands and you're set.</p>

                <p><strong>Uncommon - Malicious Eclipse</strong>. 
                    Not as strong as the rare one, but still good to have. It's enough if you get equal on board presence after this, as you'll be the one playing things first.

                    Premium removal; in 2v2, you start at 30 life, so you've got plenty to spare.

                    In the right deck, this is a wrath. Nuff said.

                <p><strong>Common - Tithing Blade</strong>
                    With the incredible amount of experience in this format that I have, I'll go ahead and say that this is good in 2v2. How many tokens will nullify this ability is yet
                    to be seen. Now the flip side? In 2v2? And in multiples? Wow.

                <p><strong>Common - Ray of Ruin</strong>. 
                    This is the removal to play when you don't have removal. Terribly overcosted, without a proper payoff.

                <p><strong>Common - Join the Dead</strong>. 
                    Sooo many creatures are going to die to this, especially at common.  Use all you can (bearing in mind that these are not permanent cards for Descend!)
                </p>

                <p><strong>Common - Dead Weight</strong>. 
                    This IS a permanent that kills, but only small creatures. One is probably okay.

                <p><strong>Common - Chupacabra Echo</strong>. 
                    This will realistically be a -2/-2 spell attached to a creature most of the time, but it might be enough in this metagame.

                Deceptively bad, as you probably won't have three black mana to play this on curve. But still good! Just not amazing ):

                <p><strong>Rare - Bringer of the Last Gift</strong>. 
                I don't know how to evaluate this, except that is more expensive than a night with the Kardashians. I guess it's better if you've been behind all game?</p>

                <p><strong>Uncommon - Deep-Cavern Bat</strong>. It seems that there's going to be 
                a 1/1 flyer in each colour, so pingers in red (if there are any) will get very valued.</p>

                <p><strong>Common - Screaming Phantom</strong>. If you get this, it will be because of the self mill. That being said, with proper 
                payoffs it can become good.</p>
                <br />

                <p><strong>Common - Deep Goblin Skulltaker</strong>. In an aggressive deck, this does wonders. Menace of big creatures is always 
                good, especially if backed up with some spells.</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: C</strong>. At its base, it's 3/2 worth of power that will go on a single creature when you eventually bargain the rat away.
                The ceiling is that you have all the rats in the world, and this becomes a 7/6 for 3 mana. Not too shabby!</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: C-</strong>. And speaking of shabby, let's talk about the tabby! The more roles you have in your deck, the better this becomes.
                A wall if you have the two mana per turn to support it (the threat to activate it is stronger than the activation itself), a trade-up in the late game no matter what.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Rating: C-/C+</strong>. Good-ish by itself, but play it with a few rats on the battlefield and suddenly your board is unstoppable.
                Even better if played when your opponent is already low in life to gain inevitability from your roles.</p>
