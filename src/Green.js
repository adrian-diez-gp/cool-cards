                <p><strong>Rating: A</strong>. This needs some setup to be goo-HAHAHA! Look at how many cards in this set
                put artifacts and/or enchantments into play, and you'll realise that this is a BEAST. Drop a color if you see one,
                you're now green/X.</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: A+</strong>. Literally the only time I wouldn't pick this is pack 3. This is 3 3/3, that
                become two 6/6, that becomes a 12/12, all with trample. WHAT?! Imagine if you could recur it from the graveyard... e.e</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: A-</strong>. Slow, but can become a wall if you need it. This blocks X/3, trades, then gets you a card and comes back (if you get a way to
                get black mana).</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: A-</strong>. A reason to look for black mana. Two real cards in one? And it's a cost 5 to boot! All the sinergies are there!</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: B</strong>. The power/toughness/mana ratio is there for the taking, but only if you're already green. Generally, the more 
                powerful cards you get, the better (surprise surprise!)</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: B+</strong>.If you don't have bargain fodder but you have creatures (and being in green, you should), this is your alternative.
                You'll almost always trade up in mana</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: B</strong>.If you need bargain fodder, this is your card. Literally an enchantment, an artifact, and a token in one card.

                <p><strong>Rating: B+</strong>. For 2 mana, it replaces itself, so you only need one or two 5 mana cards to start paying off. And LOOOTS of 
                5 mana cards have a cheaper adventure you can play earlier. Combo, anyone?</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: B+</strong>. Gingerbread man is angry that you played with his buttons. This can hit for 6 in turn 3, and further
                 foods can make him that much stronger. </p>

                <p><strong>Rating: B-</strong>. Imagine you want a card that destroys artifacts and enchantments. But that card is not always good, so you leave it in the sideboard. 
                But then you reaaaally need it in your game 1. THIS is your solution to that problem. If you draw it late, no problem -just play a huge dumdum that can't
                be chumpblocked!</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: B-</strong>. There are few things better to do in limited than play on curve. If you play a 3/3 on turn 3, followed by a 4/4 in turn 4/4,
                chances are that you're ahead in the game. If you played an adventure, this is *chef's kiss*.

                <p><strong>Rating: C++</strong>. Oh My God do I love this card. Cheeky 6/6 trample for 5 mana, that also gains you life!
                Only reason I don't put this as a B is because of the Cursed Roles. But goddd I can see the
