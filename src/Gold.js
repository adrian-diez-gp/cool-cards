                <p><strong>Rating: A</strong>. Innncredible if you find enough support. According to experts, blue/white is on the decline, so
                you'll find more support cards than normal to go with this.</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: A+</strong>. Mythic cards are coming strong!! In the dark, choose 2 or 3. Then look at your opp's cards and decide which is better.
                Also, it's a faerie!</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: A+</strong>. If you open this, shout loud so I can cry. Good when you're behind, even better when you're ahead.
                Honestly, I don't know what the fuck they were thinking when they printed this card.</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: B</strong>. Mana fixing is one of the most powerful things you can do in magic, behind drawing cards and juust above winning. Get the first ALWAYS.</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: B+</strong>. I put these here to stress how important mana fixing is. This in particular gives you a card and can be 
                bargained away later in the game, so again, pick one if you're going for off-colour adventures.</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: B-</strong>. This throws you straight into the 5 mana territory, which is something that you wanna do in these colours,
                and loots away extra lands or tries to find an answer. Solid one.</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: B</strong>. If you're in these colours, chances are you're in faeries, so the more of these you pick, the 
                happier you'll be.</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: B</strong>. You in these colurs? You pick this. You'll find support in your deck, no worries. You can also
                start attacking recklessly to grow your rat collection!</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: B</strong>. Read above. (This lets you cast adventures from the top, they're not instant cards but they're instant spells!)</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: C+</strong>. I'll never be sad to have one of these in the deck. Provides card selection, life, bargain fodder
                and replaces itself if you sac it. A true all-in-one!</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: C</strong>. Mana fixing for your adventure color, but you need to sac it to get back the adventure. Hm. Maybe if the creature side is good enough.
                Maybe.</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: C+++</strong>. If this is your first card, get it. Never sad to get "free" +1/+1 counters. From the third on,
                this card is overperforming.</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: C</strong>. In a long game, this can net you three extra cards PLUS three treasures (sneaky mana fixing!) 
                Put this in as your 22-23rd card.</p>

                <p><strong>Rating: C-</strong>. An interesting effect in colourless. Always best if you can sacrifice the creature before giving
